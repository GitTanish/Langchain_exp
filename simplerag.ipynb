They are now on the level of PhDs in many academic domains [4,6], they outperform most\\nprofessional coders in competitive programming [7], and they even display impressive emotional\\nintelligence [5]. In addition to this display of intelligence, they also come with the speed advantages\\ncomputers traditionally have had over humans. Yet, they have not had the enormous impact one\\nmight have expected from this level of intelligence \"on tap\". One could have imagined that we\\nwould have \"digital co-workers\" – AI agents which do most of the remote work in society. However,\\nsomething is clearly missing.\\nOpenAI co-founder John Schulman has speculated that the missing piece is long-term coherence [8].\\nThis is the ability for the LLMs to do tasks over long time horizons. Similarly, METR, an AI\\n1\\narXiv:2502.15840v1  [cs.AI]  20 Feb 2025'),\n",

We therefore propose Vending-Bench, a simulated\\nenvironment where LLM agents operate a vending machine. The agent must handle ordering,\\ninventory management and pricing. Each sub-task is very simple, but we observe that over long\\ntime horizons, the agent’s performance often deteriorates. That being said, some runs with the most\\ncapable LLMs, Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o3-mini, outperform the human baseline, albeit with higher\\nvariance in the results than a human would have. See Figure 1 for an overview of the benchmark.\\nFigure 1: Overview of Vending-Bench\\nOperating a vending machine involves acquiring capital and managing resources, capabilities that\\nhave dual-use potential.

We recognize this risk but believe that systematic evaluation\\nis crucial for implementing timely safety measures. Without reliable evaluation methods, we risk\\nbeing unprepared when the capabilities emerge.\\nIn the following sections we will describe Vending-Bench in greater detail, outline results from\\nrunning the benchmark, and discuss findings.\\n2 Method\\n2.1 Agent implementation\\nAn LLM agent is a computer program that allows an LLM to autonomously take actions to complete\\na task.

More complex implementations can enhance a model’s\\ncapabilities but also add implementation complexity, and potentially introduce biases that favor\\ncertain models. To balance this complexity while ensuring models are not unnecessarily constrained,\\nthe agent in Vending-Bench is a basic loop with the following additional characteristics:\\n• Context management - In each iteration, the last N (30,000 in most of our experiments) tokens\\nof the history is given to the agent as input to LLM inference.\\n• Memory tools - The agent is given read, write and delete access to three types of databases to\\ncompensate for the memory limitations: a scratchpad, key-value store and a vector database,\\nall without explicit storage constraints. The latter is implemented as a simple dictionary\\nof texts and embeddings computed using OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small model and\\nsearched with cosine similarity.\\n• Task-specific tools: Tools related to the operations of a vending machine business, further\\ndescribed below.\\nOur agent is implemented in AISI’s inspect-ai framework [1].\\n2.2 Task environment\\nThe agent has various task-specific tools at disposal. Tools related to tasks that can be carried out\\nremotely are available directly to the agent: read and write emails, research products using a search\\nengine (Perplexity), see the current storage inventory and check the money balance. However, some\\nparts of operating a vending machine requires actions in the physical world. By giving the main\\nagent access to a sub-agent, we simulate the interaction that would occur between digital AI agents\\nand humans (or robots) which operate in the real world. The sub-agent has tools to stock products in\\nthe vending machine from the storage, collect cash, set prices and get the inventory of the vending\\nmachine.\\nTo achieve this technically, we implement and open source an extension to inspect-ai [3]. Our\\nlibrary extension allows agents to delegate tasks to sub-agents. The main agent interfaces with the\\nsub-agents using the following tools:\\n• sub_agent_specs: Return info about the sub-agent, including what tools it has available.\\n• run_sub_agent: Give instructions to a sub-agent as a string and execute it.\\n• chat_with_sub_agent: Ask questions to the sub-agent to find what it did during the run.\\nEach action an agent takes moves time in the simulation forward, but the agent can also choose\\nto let time pass with the wait_for_next_day tool. Every morning, the agent is notified of what\\nitems were purchased, and if any new email has been received. To be successful, an agent needs to:\\n• Buy products from suppliers by sending e-mails\\n• Stock items in the vending machine\\n• Set competitive prices\\n• Collect earnings regularly\\n3'),\n",

In the run with the highest\\nnet worth, the model prioritized increasing its storage over maintaining cash on hand, accumulating\\nmore products as the simulation progressed. This suggests some degree of mismanagement – the\\ntraces show that instead of restocking from its storage when the vending machine inventory is\\nrunning low, it orders new products.\\nOver time, the average tool usage decreases for both models. This decline is generally explained by\\nthe decreasing number of ongoing individual runs as the number of days increases. However, it is\\nworth noting that o3-mini in particular experiences extended periods of minimal tool use, which\\nalso coincides with a drop in net worth at around 150 simulation days.\\nThe models are quite similar in what tools are used the most, as shown in Figure 6. Sonnet is\\nchatting slightly more with its sub-agent than the others, which in the traces look like it’s trying to\\nclosely understand what the sub-agent has achieved after being asked to e.g., restock the machine.\\nIn contrast, other models generally just assign tasks to the subagent, but don’t follow up how it\\nwent.\\nNot all actions by Sonnet are strategic however. It writes a lot to the scratchpad, creating a long\\ndaily summary each day including what items have been sold, what the inventory status is, and even\\na comment on if it was a good or bad day, but never retrieves the information. Though, writing out\\nsuch information may help it reason better over longer horizons, similar to chain of thought.\\n10'),\n",

Each configuration was tested over\\nfive runs. Since net worth would naturally fluctuate with these changes, we instead compared units\\nsold, as shown in Figure 11.\\nThe default starting balance is $500. Reducing it to $100 significantly lowers the number of units\\nsold, as the model has less time to cover the $2 daily fee and make a purchase from a vendor.\\nIncreasing the balance to $2,500 results in a slight increase, but the high variance makes it difficult\\nto draw clear conclusions.\\nRaising the daily fee from $2 to $5 limits the model’s ability to progress, with all runs ending before\\nreaching 100 simulated days. Interestingly however, setting the daily fee to zero does not increase\\nsales. Without the pressure of a recurring cost, the model appears to get stuck in loops, waiting for\\nthe next day instead of actively working towards making sales.\\n21'),\n",

Furthermore, if this was the\\ncase, we would expect the performance degradation to occur during the phase where the context\\nwindow is growing. Instead, some models see performance degradation well after their memory is\\nfull (and context window stop growing), e.g., +51 days for Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\\nThe Pearson correlation between \"Days Until Sales Stop\" and \"Days Until Full Memory\" across\\nthe data points in Table 9 is 0.167. Hence, the data does not support the idea that the performance\\ndegradation can solely be explained by a growing input length.\\n4 Conclusion\\nIn summary, our results show that while certain runs of state-of-the-art LLM-based agents can\\ndemonstrate remarkably effective business management in Vending-Bench, all models struggle\\nwith consistent long-horizon coherence. Failures typically arise when the agent misinterprets its\\noperational status (e.g., believing an order arrived prematurely) and then veers into tangential loops\\nor abandons the task. This is the case both for stronger and weaker models – even the most capable\\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet has runs that fail spectacularly. We show that the breakdowns are not directly\\nrelated to the context of the LLMs being filled, as models generally stagnate well after their memory\\nis full.\\nSince the benchmark score does not have a defined upper limit, saturation is not a precisely defined\\npoint.
